port of my JavaScript hydrodynamics solver to C++, 
combined with my TensorMath library so I can write every dimension case at once without using runtime-specified loop sizes, for the hopes of unrolling and template inlining for faster results 

bugs:
- slight antisymmetry of axii visible in the 2D case
- Burgers on 2D

fixes:
- speed up parallel for more
- cut down on all those dereferences?
- draw n>1-D with quads and heat colors
