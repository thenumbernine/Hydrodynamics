port of my JavaScript hydrodynamics solver to C++, 
combined with my TensorMath library so I can write every dimension case at once without using runtime-specified loop sizes, for the hopes of unrolling and template inlining for faster results 

bugs:
- slight antisymmetry of axii visible in the 2D case
