port of my JavaScript hydrodynamics solver to C++, 
combined with my TensorMath library so I can write every dimension case at once without using runtime-specified loop sizes, for the hopes of unrolling and template inlining for faster results 

depends on:
- GLApp
- TensorMath
- Profiler
- Parallel

to do:
- external forces of any kind crash - due to singular matrix - most likely due to negative sqrts, most likely due to total energy inconsistency / negative potential energies computed from the external force
- analytic flux jacobian and eignevector inverses
- cut down on all those lookups? pointer offsetting, as ugly as it is
- move Quat.h into "TensorMath" include folder? or into a "Math" include folder, and make "Tensor" a sub-folder?
- add arbitrary boundaries
- mouse interaction?
- configuration scripts, especially as I add different EOS's with new variables
