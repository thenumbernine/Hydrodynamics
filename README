port of my JavaScript hydrodynamics solver to C++, 
combined with my TensorMath library so I can write every dimension case at once without using runtime-specified loop sizes, for the hopes of unrolling and template inlining for faster results 

fixes:
- analytic flux jacobian and eignevector inverses
- thread pool in place of spawning & destroying threads
- cut down on all those lookups?
